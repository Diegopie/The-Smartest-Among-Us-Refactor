lol, so just to get this running you need to

- create the db in sequel workbench,
- run the server
- send the user req from /db/seeds/user.json
- send two postman reqs for each quiz in /db/seeds/





TODO: 
1: refactor global quizzes to work from the client (kill off user 1 junk ðŸ˜…)
2: refactor routes to have their own files instead of one chonk
3: move sensitve data to dotenv
